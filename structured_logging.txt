structures logging

log/slog

structured logging - using key/value pairs in your logging

why make slog package when there are many 3rd party ones? Well, to unify things so they all work the same 

Goals
- easy to use
- fast
- interoperable with other packages

see slide on how you do it - there is text handler and json handler

LogAttrs (is faster) you specify the type (so it doesn't need to do inference) - see slide

Levels 
- are ints
- some have names (Debug, Info, Warn, Error)
- room for your own names
- info is 0

use groups to make json sub-objects

groups can also help with the issue of conflicting names

the Logger.With - allows you to have something added to everything in that log
