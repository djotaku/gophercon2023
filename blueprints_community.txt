The Blueprints to Building Your Own Badass Community

Go is becoming a global language - community is key

understnading goals is important to help with your motivation and planning

does a community already exist? Get involved rather than just starting a new one?

Are there meetups you can take inspiration from?

planning your event: 
understand your limitations and manage your expectations

Gather interest from work, friends or othes (aka seeding) - others see at least some people there. (Like when a busker puts dollars in their guitar case)

securing a venue (see slide)

define comms channels ahead of time - what if it gets canceled.  

Make sure you understand the Go communicty code of conduct

what if your first event was a disaster?
1. review and reflect
2. 
3. remember to celebrate - you can still be sad and eat ice cream

what if your first event was good enough to do another?
1. same as before
2. streamline processes - you will notice repetition and boilerplate
3. Try not to give into ego

"Can a tech meetup have Code Smell?" - interesting article to look up

Introduced Priority Queue because they were getting too many potential attendees. They save 20% for underrepresented in tech spots

what if you want out - after one or more events you no longer want to be the organizer
1. 
2. it can be hard but know you can leave at any time. Make sure to get those who might want to take over.
3. Remember to celebrate
