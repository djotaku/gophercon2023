Wed keynote - Go Changes
Rus Cox

Go has to change because it has to adapt. 

Talk is about how change is decided for the language.

Changes they want
-----------------
It's all based on the goal - "better software engineering at scale"

"software engineering is what happens to programming when you add time and other programmers"

the go goal is why it had testing built in from the beginning

gofmt - avoids spuroius diffs just because you disagree on formatting.

Unambiguous import paths - make for better software engineering when there's a package name collision

other examples including removing support for insecure systmes

Data-driven decisions
---------------------


Go toolchain telemetry (opt-in)
