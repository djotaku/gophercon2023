Everything you alwawy wanted to know abou ttype inference

type inference is the ability toe automaticlaly deduce the type of an expression at compile time....without explicit type annotations

it's already done in go from what's on the righthand side of the equals sign

it's good for removing repetition

with generics in Go, there can be many more types.

(don't be dogmatic - if it makes the code easier to read - use them)

Type inference can be seen as solving Type equations
